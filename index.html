    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>I always thought that Lit was supposed to be an easy class. A chill and fun class where you don't really have to worry about your grade dropping to a b, and where you write one or two essays per book which arn't even graded that hard. Clarke proves otherwise. In Clarke's class, you can't just wing reading the book, and you definetily caan't wing the essay's on writing assignments, because thats gonna take a tole on your grade. Clarke grades a bit hard. And a bit is probably a bit of an understatement - even the best writers didn't get A's on the first rq's, the highest grade was a b+ (depressisng, i know). But that doesnt hold up for the rest of the semester, and grades go up. in the beginning, people just don't write how Clarke wants them to, and he hands out Bs and Cs. Then he starts giving out tips on what he wants, and then everyone's grades improve. That's why starting assignments are worth less, and later assignments more, to "reward those that show improvement"(Clarke), so you should take advantage of that and try to improve(obviously). A B is a decent grade in Clarke, but it'l likely keep you hanging very close to the a/b cutoff, which is scary when its the end of the semester and the last few assignments decide your grade (and life). Btw these are based on Clarke grading scale (2021-2022). A B+ is a decent grade, and should be enough to hold your grade at an A, but its still a bit risky. An A- and A are pretty good and if you get one just try to keep it up. We don't talk about A+s. When you get an A+ you get "touched by god". But one thing to not miss definetily is ok poitns. They are clarkes version of graded on completion assignments, and do not miss any of them or your grade will tank (trust me it will). Theyr free points and shame on you if you dont get them (jk). Ok thats probably a lot for an intro but ok then Something stupid ritam help me make this</p>

    <p>The class is pretty hard</p>

<div class="body-div" id="actual body lmao">
    <h2>RQs</h2>
    <p>Rqs are basically 1/2 essays written in class analysing a passage written in 30 minutes. They're worth the majority of your grade so its pretty important to not f those up. Clarke has very specific expectations for rqs, and even the best writers don't get As on their first Rqs (b+ was the highest grade). Every teacher's expectations are different, and Clarke is no exception. Even Clarke admits that “It’s not that they’re bad”(Clarke) and they are just not “the way [he] wants them”(Clarke). I can't spill a whole lot of tips on rqs but here are some. 1. Read the book and know it (trust me dont wing it) 2. Don't put any questionable analysis 3. Talk to the smart people and get freeeee analysis. However, even if you arn't about to get As or A-s, it's still possible to get an A(-) in Clarke while getting all writing assignments Bs and below (tried and tested for grading scale 2021-2022)</p>

<div class="body-div" id="actual body lmao">
    <h2>Secret to RQs</h2>
    <p>Although rqs are graded somewhat arbitrarily, there are some people who always manage to get As and A-s on them. I always wished that these smart people told me how to get it until i got an A. The thing is, there isn't just one secret that makes you get an A but your analysis just has to be good and you can't f up on any other part of it. That's just how it is. And thats partly why the samples arn't of much help too</p>
</div>

<div class="body-div" id="actual body lmao">
    <h2>RQ Samples</h2>
    <p>If you go and ask Mr. Clarke for help, he’ll tell you to look at the samples. So are they helpful? Sort of, but not really. Basically, when you look at them probably won’t see anything, and it's really hard to find anything without knowing what you’re looking for (mainly for the analysis). Some RQs have more of something, and other RQs have more of another thing, but they usually have one thing in common: sound analysis. But sound or unsound is Clarke's decision. So, if you go to the samples without looking for anything in advance, you probably won’t find anything and will think that Clarke’s grades are arbitrary (and they are to an extent, see this(LINK down to arbitrary)). But the samples got A’s for a reason, and you can ask Clarke about them. In fact, someone explicitly asked him “Why did this person get an A and I didn’t?” And Clarke told him (sorry idk if we can say what). Is it worth studying the samples, though? From my experience, no, partly because it didn’t work, and also because what he’s looking for changes from book to book, as does his grading style. For two rq’s in a row I studied the samples, and i got two b’s (rip). However, You should study one thing: The book</p>
