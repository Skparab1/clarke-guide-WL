<div class="body-div" id="actual body lmao">
    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>I always thought that Lit was supposed to be an easy class. A chill and fun class where you don't really have to worry about your grade dropping to a b, and where you write one or two essays per book which arn't even graded that hard. Clarke proves otherwise. Something stupid ritam help me make this</p>

<h2>Mr Clarke</h2>
<p>Clarke is actually a nice person</p>

    <h2>World Lit Class</h2>
    <p>The class is pretty hard</p>
</div>

<div class="body-div" id="actual body lmao">
    <h2>RQs</h2>
    <p>Rqs are basically 1/2 essays written in class analysing a passage written in 30 minutes. They're worth the majority of your grade so its pretty important to not f those up. Clarke has very specific expectations for rqs, and even the best writers don't get As on their first Rqs (b+ was the highest grade). Every teacher's expectations are different, and Clarke is no exception. Even Clarke admits that “It’s not that they’re bad”(Clarke) and they are just not “the way [he] wants them”(Clarke). I can't spill a whole lot of tips on rqs but here are some. 1. Read the book and know it (trust me dont wing it) 2. Don't put any questionable analysis 3. Talk to the smart people and get freeeee analysis. However, even if you arn't about to get As or A-s, it's still possible to get an A(-) in Clarke while getting all writing assignments Bs and below (tried and tested for grading scale 2021-2022)</p>

<div class="body-div" id="actual body lmao">
    <h2>Secret to RQs</h2>
    <p>Although rqs are graded somewhat arbitrarily, there are some people who always manage to get As and A-s on them. I always wished that these smart people told me how to get it until i got an A. The thing is, there isn't just one secret that makes you get an A but your analysis just has to be good and you can't f up on any other part of it. That's just how it is. And thats partly why the samples arn't of much help too</p>
</div>

<div class="body-div" id="actual body lmao">
    <h2>RQ Samples</h2>
    <p>If you go and ask Mr. Clarke for help, he’ll tell you to look at the samples. So are they helpful? Sort of, but not really. Basically, when you look at them probably won’t see anything, and it's really hard to find anything without knowing what you’re looking for (mainly for the analysis). Some RQs have more of something, and other RQs have more of another thing, but they usually have one thing in common: sound analysis. But sound or unsound is Clarke's decision. So, if you go to the samples without looking for anything in advance, you probably won’t find anything and will think that Clarke’s grades are arbitrary (and they are to an extent, see this(LINK down to arbitrary)). But the samples got A’s for a reason, and you can ask Clarke about them. In fact, someone explicitly asked him “Why did this person get an A and I didn’t?” And Clarke told him (sorry idk if we can say what). Is it worth studying the samples, though? From my experience, no, partly because it didn’t work, and also because what he’s looking for changes from book to book, as does his grading style. For two rq’s in a row I studied the samples, and i got two b’s (rip). However, You should study one thing: The book</p>
